# 🧠 Lovable.dev Prompt Assistant

Welcome! This repository helps **non-developers** use the AI-powered platform [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) more effectively by converting your natural language ideas into high-quality prompts — with help from ChatGPT.

---

## ✨ What’s in This Repo?

- `Prompt Library.txt` – The official Lovable.dev Prompt Library, which contains all the reusable prompt templates (required for the workflow).
- `README.md` – This instruction guide.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Lovable.dev is powerful, but to use it well, your prompts need to be clear and structured. This repo makes that easy — even if you don’t know code — by giving you:

- ✅ A ready-made prompt for ChatGPT
- ✅ A downloadable Lovable Prompt Library
- ✅ Instructions anyone can follow

---

## 🧾 How to Use with ChatGPT

### ✅ Step 1: Download the Prompt Library

Download the file [`Prompt Library.txt`](./Prompt%20Library.txt) from this repository. This file contains the official set of prompt patterns from Lovable.dev.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Copy This Prompt into ChatGPT

Paste the following message into ChatGPT:

"I’m sharing the full Lovable.dev Prompt Library below, followed by a short description of what I want to build or fix.

Your job is to:

Understand the full Lovable.dev Prompt Library I’ve shared.

Treat anything I write after it as unstructured natural language input — not a technical prompt.

Based on that input, generate a precise, structured Lovable.dev prompt using the right section and tone from the Prompt Library (e.g. Starting Projects, UI/UX Design, Supabase, etc.).

If the task is complex, break it into multiple prompts."

Here is the full Lovable.dev Prompt Library:
[📂 Upload the content from your downloaded Prompt Library.txt into ChatGPT]




Now, here’s what I want to build or fix (this is not a prompt, just an idea):

[💬 Write your idea here — e.g., “I want to build an app to track my gym workouts and show charts,” or “I made a form but it doesn’t work on mobile.”]

## 🧠 Example Use

I want to build an app to track my water intake and show charts for each day. I don’t know the tech stack or anything. I just want it to look modern and work on my phone.


ChatGPT will respond with a professional Lovable.dev prompt like:

> I need a **hydration tracking** application with:  
> - **Tech Stack**: React + Tailwind frontend, Supabase backend  
> - **Core Features**: Daily water intake logging, historical chart view, mobile-first UI, and reminders  
> ... (full prompt continues)
